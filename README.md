#UQS

## About
----------------------------------------------------------
The problem and how we solved it
----------------------------------------------------------

Here in the Philippines, queues in banks, schools, and government agencies could consume a lot of time and energy from people. People complain about waiting in long line. In certain cases, there are some who stay in a queue, while wanting to run some errands. But they canâ€™t do them simultaneously. This is a type of a problem that almost every one of us encounter daily. Hence, we created a solution.

When it comes to software for digital queuing, there's a bunch of them out there, but they are specific to one service. We created a Unified digital queuing software, where at a glance, you can see services, and queue without worrying about staying in the vicinity the whole time because it notifies you when your turn is near.

If you are a student like us or someone who needs to pay bills over the counter and want to manage time efficiently, you will surely benefit using UQS. Now you can attend your classes and meeting or go shopping while queuing online, anytime, anywhere and not worry about missing the line. Our goal is simple and straight forward. It is to create an app that provides efficient service not only for people but also for institutions (by helping them provide better quality of service) and make the long waiting in-line a thing in the past.
